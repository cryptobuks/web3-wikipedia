# web3-wikipedia
Our project is a web3 version of wikipedia. This project uses the DAO design concept to share your knowledge more precisely. web3 version of wikipedia works with metamask to allow you to share your knowledge with others.
The system de-centralizes the construction of text-based collective knowledge with the following concepts

1. ErC20 token-based governance and voting approval process
2. token incentives in submissions and voting
3. use of voting snapshots employing IPFS.

The platform also includes the following ways to earn tokens

1. when you make a new wiki contribution and are recognized by others with a rating
2. rating other people's contributions.

**web3-wikpedia uses a Good/Bad voting system for evaluation: if the number of Good votes is greater than the number of Bad votes, your wiki contribution will be accepted and merged. (The rating system may be changed in the future.)

This type of token-earning system allows us to keep the quality of submissions up to date, and also allows us to make a profit on an individual basis, which we can then link to the operation of the wiki.
